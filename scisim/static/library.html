    <p><h3>Water Quality</h3></p>

    <p>2013 Water Quality Data</p>

    <p><a href="http://floridaswater.com/hydrologicdata/waterquality/surfacewater/summary.html">http://floridaswater.com/hydrologicdata/waterquality/surfacewater/summary.html</a></p>

    <p><h3><u>Water Quality Assessment </h3></u></p>

    <p><h3> Temperature </h3></p>
    <p>Temperature is an extremely critical factor in controlling the chemistry in the lagoon and the chemistry that occurs within all living organisms.  For example, temperature will affect the solubility of certain chemicals (like oxygen) in the lagoon, water density, and current movement/s. Temperature can also speed up or slow down biochemical reactions causing animals to grow slower or faster. The Indian River Lagoon is shallow and therefore will change temperature rapidly depending on the time of year. Overall increases in ocean temperature will also affect the lagoon. </p>

    <p><h3> Salinity </h3></p>
    <p>Salinity is a measure of the amount of salt dissolved in water. Ocean water has high salinity whereas freshwater has very low salinity. The level of salinity in the water will also impact the water density and ultimately how the water will mix. Haloclines are an example of when freshwat/er and salt water form an underwater “boundary” caused by their different densities—follow this link (<a href="http://www.teamkarst.org/asgard.htm) if you are interested in seeing a picture, it’s the third one from the top!">http://www.teamkarst.org/asgard.htm) if you are interested in seeing a picture, it’s the third one from the top!</a></p>

    <p>Remember, the Indian River Lagoon is a estuary and contains both salt and freshwater. Depending on how close you are to either a fresh or oceanic input will dictate the salinity level of the water and what species live in that particular region. Sudden influxes of freshwater can change t/he overall salinity levels and impact animals such as clams that live in the Indian River Lagoon. The region of Florida surrounding the lagoon is one of the fastest growing areas in the state of Florida.  This can wreck havoc on the lagoon because of freshwater runoff and pollution from failed septic systems (about 10% of thousands will fail each year). </p>

    <p><h3> Dissolved Oxygen </h3></p>
    <p>Dissolved Oxygen is a measure of how much Oxygen is in the water. Oxygen is critical for the survival of many animal and plant species, and without enough oxygen many species will die. The amount of Oxygen in the water depends on the temperature (hot water = less oxygen) and salinity (mo/re salt = less oxygen). </p>

    <p>Appropriate levels of dissolved oxygen is a major problem in the Indian River Lagoon. Nutrients from agriculture or septic system failure result in algal blooms—after these algae die, they are eaten by bacteria in the lagoon which consume all of the available oxygen killing many aquat/ic organisms. </p>

    <p><h3> Water Clarity </h3></p>
    <p>Plants need light in order to photosynthesize and survive. If the water is murky from high rain, runoff from construction sites/streets/yards, or boat traffic in shallow areas, plants cannot obtain enough light to survive. Algal blooms can also decrease sunlight in the Indian River Lago/on causing death of sea grasses and other photosynthetic species. Without aquatic plants like sea grass, there is less food, shelter, and habitat for other species. Lots of particles in the water can also clog the gills of fish and shellfish and kill them, or provide foundations for microorganism growth. </p>

    <p><h3> pH </h3></p>
    <p>Water can act as a buffer to protect aquatic life from drastic changes in pH. However, if you overwhelm the buffering capabilities, the pH can dramatically change to acidic or basic levels causing major mortalities in animals. pH is impacted by the salinity as well and can range from 6-8 /in the lagoon. The higher the salinity, the less susceptible the pH is to change and the safer it is for the animals that live there. As the amount of salt decreases, the water’s ability to resist changes in pH also changes. </p>
