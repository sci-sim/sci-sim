1. ~~I can't see any of the pictures~~. 

2. The residents aren't appearing in random order each time a new simulation is starting. Same comment with the tests. 

3. Some of the residents have 7 tests that you can perform in the first half--Ms. Watson has all 8 and I think she is the only one with all 8. I also noticed that for Mr. Smith you have to do 4 tests and for the rest, you have to do 3 to move on. Everything in the second half looks more consistent. 

4.~~ Under the hypothesis testing page, the text reads " enter hypothesis on left side of the screen" there is no left side of the screen, so these directions don't make sense.~~ 

~~How about we update both hypothesis pages to have the following format and text (green color means different text goes here during the second half) If it isn't obvious what should be inserted, I can make the edits.~~ 

~~Heading:~~ 
~~What health problems do the residents have? ​~~ 

​~~Then text:~~ 

~~Your first job is to figure out what health problems the residents have. You will do this by asking questions and proposing hypotheses.~~ 

~~What questions would you like to answer when you examine the patients? What will you look for? What will help you determine why the residents in Katzville are unhealthy? Enter your questions in the text box below:~~

~~(text box here)~~

~~A hypothesis is a proposed but simple answer to a question. What are your hypotheses for why the residents of Katzville are unhelathy? Fill in possible hypotheses below:~~

~~(text box here)~~

~~Why did you choose this questions and hypotheses?~~

~~(Text box here)~~

~~When you examine the residents on the next page, what will you look for to see if your questions and hypotheses are supported? <--THIS ONE IS NEW!!~~

~~(Text box here)~~

5. ~~BMI calculator is still opening in the same window and causes the user to exit the simulation~~

6. For the sound files, is there a way to pause the sound? 

7. Is it possible to have 'go back' features put in so students and go back and re-test a patient? Particularly if they find something out that is interesting and they want to go back and see something? 

8. Conclusions for part 1--there is still no box for text entry

Also, would it be possible to have "Your initial questions were....blah Your initial hypothesis was ....blah" instead of "your said?" 

The way it is on resident's conclusions works. 

9. I just got booted out at the section on genetic testing...there is no continue/go back button. Or, better yet, a text box that says "What were this resident's results? Does this support or refute your hypothesis?"

10. Last hypothesis page--nothing is carrying over from the lab notebook and there is no text box for entry. I also can't move beyond this page to the final conclusions section to see how that looks.
